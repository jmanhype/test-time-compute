# Example Problem
Find the integral of x^2 dx.

# Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:
1. The integral of x^2 is x^3/3 + C by the power rule
2. No boundary conditions are given, so we include + C
3. Double-check: derivative of x^3/3 is x^2, confirming our answer

(x^3 / 3) + C

# Example Problem
Solve the differential equation dy/dx + 2y = x^2

# Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:
1. This is a first-order linear differential equation
2. The integrating factor is e^(âˆ«2dx) = e^(2x)
3. Multiply both sides: e^(2x)(dy/dx + 2y) = x^2 * e^(2x)
4. Solve for y using integration by parts
5. Simplify and verify the solution
